        JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.

JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.

JavaScript is easy to learn.

This tutorial will teach you JavaScript from basic to advanced.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Why Study JavaScript?
      </h3>
      <p>
        JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          HTML to define the content of web pages
        </li>
        <li>
          CSS to specify the layout of web pages
        </li>
        <li>JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages
          </li>
      </ol>

        While you ultimately need to know both of the aforementioned stacks, you are better off starting with a strongly typed, compiled language like Java that comes with an easy-to-configure, fully integrated IDE. Strong typing and compilation will let you focus on developing proper coding habits, while a mostly auto-configured development environment will get you writing, testing, running, and – most importantly – delivering your code quickly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Walk before you run. Experience with JavaScript is inevitable as you wander into web development, but it is healthier to start your growth as a software developer with a strong object-oriented foundation. Learn one of the foundational languages, then let your mind take you in any direction that you find interesting and exciting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Java has been a mainstay for connecting legacy enterprise systems to highly dynamic web interfaces, giving it broad use in the enterprise world. It has the backing of a lot of major corporations and is heavily used in their stack.
      </p>

        JavaScript appears to be a natural disrupter popping up in various places. While it was born to serve the client side application needs within a browser, JavaScript traveled to the server and desktop through NodeJS and is clearly here to stay. Excellent UI frameworks – like AngularJS – can work synergistically with any kind of back-end implementation.

  <section class="main-section" id="Statements">
    <header>Statements</header>
    <p>
      JavaScript statements are composed of:
    </p>
    <p>
      Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.
    </p>
    <p>
    This statement tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly." inside an HTML element with id="demo":
    </p>
    <code>document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly.";
    </code>
    <p>Most JavaScript programs contain many JavaScript statements.
</p>
<p>
  The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written.
</p>
<p>JavaScript programs (and JavaScript statements) are often called JavaScript code.</p>
<h3>Semicolons ;</h3>
<p>
Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.</p>
<p>
Add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement:</p>
<code><p>let a, b, c;  // Declare 3 variables</p>
<p>a = 5;        // Assign the value 5 to a</p>
<p>b = 6;        // Assign the value 6 to b</p>
<p>c = a + b;    // Assign the sum of a and b to c</p></code>
  </section>

    <header>Variables</header>
    <article>
      <p>
        Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).
      </p>

      <p>
       In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the var keyword:
      </p>
      <code>var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;</code>
<p>In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the let keyword:</p>
<code>let x = 5;
let y = 6;
let z = x + y;</code>
<p>In this example, x, y, and z, are undeclared variables:</p>
<code>x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y;</code>
<p>From all the examples above, you can guess:</p>
<ul>
  <li>x stores the value 5</li>
  <li>y stores the value 6</li>
  <li>z stores the value 11</li>
</ul>
